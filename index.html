            Ayrton Senna da Silva was born on <mark>March 21, 1960</mark>, into
            a wealthy Brazilian family where, with his brother and sister, he
            enjoyed a privileged upbringing. He never needed to race for money
            but his deep need for racing began with an infatuation for a
            miniature go-kart his father gave him when he was four years old. As
            a boy the highlights of Ayrton's life were Grand Prix mornings when
            he awoke trembling with anticipation at the prospect of watching his
            Formula One heroes in action on television.
            <mark
              >At 13 he raced a kart for the first time and immediately
              won</mark
            >. Eight years later he went single-seater racing in Britain, where
            in three years he won five championships, by which time he had
            divorced his young wife and forsaken a future in his father's
            businesses in favour of pursuing success in Formula One racing,
            where he made his debut with Toleman in <mark>1984</mark>. At Monaco
            (a race he would win six times), his sensational second to Alain
            Prost's McLaren - in torrential rain - was confirmation of the
            phenomenal talent that would take the sport by storm.

            One notable incident of the year was at the Monaco Grand Prix, where
            Senna out-qualified Prost by 1.4 seconds and led for most of the
            race before crashing on lap 67.[56] Instead of returning to the pit
            lane, Senna was so distressed by his own mistake that he went back
            to his apartment and did not contact the team until he walked into
            the pit garage as they were packing up later that night. After team
            manager Jo Ramirez called him through his Monaco apartment's cleaner
            hours after he had crashed, Senna was still devastated by his own
            mistake.
